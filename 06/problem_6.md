# Union and Intersection

Union: O(n) = n + n => 2n => n

Intersection: O(n) = n + n => 2n => n

Review comments fixed
---------------------
1. Union and intersection are set operations hence they should also uphold set properties which include the uniqueness of values in the results
2. Review 2 - Added additional boundary test sets.
